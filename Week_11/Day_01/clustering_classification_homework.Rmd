# Classification and Clustering

<br>


Classification and clustering are types of pattern identification
Classification uses predefined classes that objects within a dataset are assigned to, whereas clustering identifies similarities between objects and groups these together.
Clustering is a method of *unsupervised* learning, as there is only one set of input data that we extract information from without knowing what the output will be
Classification is a type of *supervised* learning as we know the input data and its classes, so we know the possible output of the model.

# Hierarchical Clustering

- This groups similar objects together in clusters
- It starts by treating each observation as a single cluster
- It then finds the two clusters that are closest together (?)
  - you can do this using a range of methods, simplest is to take the distance between each point on the scatter plot 
- These two clusters are then merged into one
- This process continues until all clusters are merged together
- Finally you are left with a dendogram that shows a visual representation of the relationship between all the clusters
- The height where two clusters are merged represents the distance between the two clusters
